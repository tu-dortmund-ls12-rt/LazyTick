## Requirements
The following software and hardware requirements need to be met in order to replicate the evaluation results.

### Software Environment
The following software environment is required to run the code of this artifact:
- Linux host (tested with Debian 12.11 x86)
- Packages needed for esp-idf (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.1/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html#for-linux-users):
    git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-pip python3-venv cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util libusb-1.0-0
- python3 (tested with python 3.11.2)
- Gurobi license to solve the MIQCP
- LaTeX to generate the figures from the csv data

### Required Hardware
The following hardware is required to replicate the results:
- ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N32R8V
